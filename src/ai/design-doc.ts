Aederyn Online is a text based MMO which has a world and a social system.
The world is made up of tiles which contain one or more resources which a user can 
interact with to obtain items.

The social system allows users to chat with other users in the world.

The aim of the game is to craft, collect and complete tasks, eventually unlocking portal tiles which
progress the user into different worlds.

The current game is missing tiered items and zones, things like mountains and mines, forests and marshes.

Items that are not a reward of resources should be obtainable by the user either by new resources, or as rewards to tasks.

The game should be a fun and engaging experience.
